## Overview
This project provides a semi-automated tool for monoplotting that enables photogrammetric measurements using oblique historical images and minimal user input. It includes:

- A new semi-automatic monoplotting framework boosts spatial data analysis.
- Key point matching enhances pixel-world mapping.
- Pose estimate is improved via gradient-based optimization.
- ML integration advances Earth science applications
- ML-monoplotting is a new method toward spatial intelligence.
